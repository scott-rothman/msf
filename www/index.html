					We’re calling on GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer to drop the price of the lifesaving pneumonia vaccine to $5 per child (for all three doses) in all developing countries.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most people don’t know that through their (401K) retirement savings plan or through direct investment in mutual funds that they likely have money and influence in these Big Pharmaceutical companies.

							It is an under-reported fact that pneumococcal disease kills more children under five than any other disease. Nearly one million children die from it each year. <a href="#">[1]</a>
						</p>
						<p>
							For the past two years, Doctors Without Borders has been campaigning, gathering the support of hundreds of thousands of people from around the world to encourage Pfizer and GSK to reduce the price of the vaccine. Thanks to public pressure, at the end of last year Pfizer and GSK finally announced that they would reduce the price of the vaccine for humanitarian organisations like us. We now need your help to lower the price of the vaccine in all developing countries. We know we can be heard, and the fight is not over. 
						</p>
						<h2>
							How can you help?
						</h2>
						<p>
							You might not know it but through your retirement savings plan or your investment in mutual funds you might have money in Pfizer and GSK and can use this power to demand change.

			<h5>A really quick lesson the influence you have with the money you invest:</h5>
			<p>When you invest your money through mutual funds or ETFs you delegate the voting authority on the shares of the underlying companies in the fund to the fund managers</p>
			<p>So tell your fund manager that you want to drop the price.
				Both Pfizer and GSK have their annual shareholder meetings coming up in Q2 (late April and May respectively). Let’s have our voices heard in this forum. Use the email template below to let your fund manager know how they can best represent your interests when it comes to your values and your money.

				<textarea type="text" id="message">Dear [Fund Manager Name],

I am invested in [Fund Name] and it has come to my attention that GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer are included in the investment portfolio. 

I am aligned with the goals of AFAIRSHOT.ORG and want to see both companies reduce the price of the life-saving pneumonia vaccine to $5 per child in crisis-affected populations and for all developing countries.

As you hold my voting authority for these companies through my investment in your fund, I want you to represent my interests at the upcoming annual shareholder meetings for both companies.

Please confirm you’ve received this email and the steps you will take to have our voices heard at the shareholder meetings.

Sincerely,
</textarea>
